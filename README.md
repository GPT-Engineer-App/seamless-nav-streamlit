# seamless-nav-streamlit

Build a Streamlit application in Python with seamless navigation across two pages. The first page should enable users to upload a CSV file and input values into five designated fields. On the following page, users will find a table displaying numbers from 1 to 5 in the first column and the corresponding values entered on the previous page. Importantly, ensure that navigating between pages does not reset the input or uploaded file.
